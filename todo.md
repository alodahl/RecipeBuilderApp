# New ToDos
- Make sure it works at 320px up to cover all bases.
- Change the screenshots of the project on iOS devices. -> Show images of the recipes grid & modal. Explain the captures
- Center "Welcome to Recipe Builder!" vertically(use same margin/padding on top and bottom). when on small devices.
- The text inside the "Add" button should also be vertically centered within this button. Same with "Find Recipes".  Test this on iPhone + Firefox.

Done
- The main thing stopped me from approving the project is under 500px, it's not responsive.
