# Recipe Builder

This recipe search uses the Edamam Recipe API to search for recipes based on ingredients.  Enter as many ingredients as you like to search for recipes with that combination. Removing ingredients from your search is a simple as clicking the ingredient name.

Recipe Builder was a response to the need to be creative with ingredients I already had, and going shopping before meal time was not an option.

## Technologies used

Recipe Builder employs HTML, CSS styling, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX to retrieve and display API data.
